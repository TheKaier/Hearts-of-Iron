Jiang Jieshi = 
After the revolution of 1911 toppled the late Manchu emperor, the Republic of China was still struggling. In the remote areas, the warlords were divided, and in the Central Plain area, red bandits were entrenched in the foothills. Beyond its borders, the Japanese invaders installed a puppet regime led by Emperor Modi Puyi and tried to bring the whole of China under their control. Surrounded by powerful enemies, the Chiang Kai-shek administration will have to make tough choices to lead China and carve out a new path. = 

Nation.Germany = Germany
Germany.startIntroPart = A new Germany was emerging, three years after the Weimar Republic was dissolved and replaced by Hitler's Third Reich. Now, after struggling through the early years of the Great Depression, the economic order is stabilizing and mass unemployment has been addressed.\n\nThe restrictions imposed on the German Army by the Treaty of Versailles had long been forgotten, the Wehrmacht was growing, and another world war was on the horizon.


Nation.Japan = Japan
Japan.startIntroPart = After the unification of Japan during the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Great Japanese Empire experienced a period of rapid Westernization and industrialization. The goal is to make Japan a power on a par with other Western countries. Japan, with its industrial power, made up for the lack of domestic resources by invading its neighbors, such as the invasion of Korea that began in 1895. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Japan occupied Taiwan. After that, Japan won the Russo-Japanese War in 1904-1905. Consolidated its position as one of the world powers and the first non-European country to gain this status. Allied with Britain in 1902, Japan joined the Allies in World War I and conquered German colonies in the Pacific and China.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the Japanese Government became increasingly militaristic and conquered northeast China in 1931, Thus created the Manchukuo puppet state. In 1933, Japan further occupied Chinese territory, leading to more puppet states, such as Mongolia. The Japanese Government has begun to announce an " Asia is Asia for Asians " campaign, in which, They more or less meant " Asia is Japanese Asia " and had a series of " liberation " wars. In fact, this is a further scramble for land and resources. However, the Japanese Government is still not satisfied, and at the expense of all, Seek to further expand Japan's rule in East Asia and its " Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Circle ". Japan made numerous plans to conquer Asia, some of which were to invade the East Asian continent and split the Republic of China into loyal puppet states. Others involved the invasion of British India, while others involved the invasion of the European colonies of Indonesia and India. Even greater plans called for the invasion of the Soviet Union to seize the vast resources, wealth and territory of Siberia, Another plan involves targeting Australia and new Zealand, and Japan's biggest ambition is to invade the United States of America, To ensure control of Japan's resources and industries, and to overthrow the U.S. government, so that Japan dominate the Pacific region, thus becoming a continental power. The Japanese empire was the most powerful force in East Asia, ready to destroy any country that stood in its way.

Nation.France = France
France.startIntroPart = France, together with the United Kingdom, declared protection of Poland and declared war on Germany when the German state invaded Poland. France was blindly confident under the protection of the Maginot Line on the Franco-German border, but in 1940, It took the Confederates only six weeks to lose. France had high hopes for the war, Germany saw little chance, Hence the gamble of sending armored divisions to gather fire in the forests of Luxembourg and Ardennes to break through the lines. Kamerin, the French commander-in-chief, did not think the area could support the armour. The tanks did advance into France, however, and even crossed Northern France to the English Channel without being stopped by the reserves. They surrounded the Allied forces in Belgium. The Allies were overconfident in their predictions of the German Army and believed that they would break through in Belgium like Schlieffen in the First World War.\n\nAs the situation deteriorated, the United Kingdom withdrew its troops before the fall of Dunkirk. Shortly thereafter, the French front collapsed, the German offensive began on June 14, and Paris was declared an open city and fell. And on June 24, the full occupation of Northern France (the front line from Bordeaux to Grenoble). The complete collapse of the French Army, presided over by the French Government on June 25 agreed to a truce, announced the surrender, to the world impact. Before that, France was an economic and military power - winning the First World War just 20 years ago.\n\nAfter the defeat, the Germans occupied eastern and Northern France, and Italy occupied parts of Southern France, The rest of the French territory was placed in Vichy France. A puppet state under Vichy France, led by Marshal Bettencourt, whose de facto capital was in Vichy France. On the other hand, the French colonies were either occupied by the United Kingdom and the Free French Army under General De Gaulle. Either submit to or be conquered by the Axis powers (mainly Italy and Japan).

Largely because of its limited strategic resources, Poland has been unable to struggle to keep pace with its neighbors' fierce armaments. The subsequent Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany paved the way for the two countries' claim to Polish territory. Soon war broke out.\n\nIn a common sense, World War II began on September 1, 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland. Subsequently, as the Allied powers of the United Kingdom and France guaranteed Poland's independence, they declared War on Germany, but there was no real pressure on Germany. Nearly 100 French divisions entered Germany, But was ordered to suspend operations a kilometre from the Siegfried Line, where few troops were stationed, And retreated to the original position of the Maginot Line. For the next eight months, there were only skirmishes and an almost illusory quiet " Phoney War " on the Western Front. The Allies did nothing. After the Eastern Front War, a German officer said that if Britain and France launched an attack on Germany, Germany could only hold out for a few weeks.\n\nThe last division of the Polish army surrendered on October 6 after a month of resistance against the German-Soviet forces, but the Polish government never formally surrendered. Indeed, their resistance is one of the best organized in Europe, including schools and so on. The Polish struggle continues on the Western Front, The Polish fleet and the remnants of the Polish army made a detour from the flag of the Kingdom of Romania to France and then to England.\n\nPolish soldiers played a key role in the war, including the Battle of Britain, The Battle of Narvik and the Battle of Monte Cassino. But the post-war Iron Curtain speech and the division of power in Europe between the Allies and the Comintern, The Cold War broke out between the two groups, and Poland became a satellite of the Soviet Union, whose true independence could not be restored until the collapse of the Soviet Union.
